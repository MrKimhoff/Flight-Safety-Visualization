# Flight Travel Safety Visualization Project

This project uses primarily Power BI to create data visualizations and present a compelling data story about how traveling by air is safe. This project was a requirement for one of my courses during my Master's program at Bellevue University

#### -- Project Status: `Completed`

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to leverage the capabilities of Power BI to read in data and create useful data visualizations that can be used to convince an audience that traveling by air is safe.

### Methods Used
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualizaiton
* Summary Statistics

### Technologies Used
* Power BI
* Canva (Tool to create infographic)
* MS Office (PowerPoint, Word)

## Project Description
The first step of this project was data collection. There were several airline safety datasets used in this project. After the data was selected, it was imported into the Power BI tool and some minor data cleansing and feature extracted steps were executed.

The types of visualizations that were created include:
* Line Charts
* Scatterplots
* Bubble Charts
* Bar Charts
* etc.

After the graphics were created, there are several files that present them in different formats. There is an executive summary that was designed to be presented to an airline's executive members regarding the safety of flight travel. There is a blog post that serves as a more free-form style of presenting the information. I wrote it to be a little more emotionally charged than the others, as I was attempting to sway my "audience." There is also an infographic that was designed to be released to a broader audience, and was created using the Canva online web application. The final format was a presentation that could have been displayed on the nightly news.
